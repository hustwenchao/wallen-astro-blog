				This is Wallencai's Blog. I am a developer who loves to share my thoughts and experiences with you.
			</p>

			<p>
				My work is mainly focused on <b>game development</b>, web development, and software development. I will share some of my experiences and thoughts on these topics.
			</p>

				I am also an avid reader and love to dive into books of various genres. Reading allows me to explore different worlds, gain knowledge, and broaden my perspective. Whether it's fiction, non-fiction, or self-help books, I find joy and inspiration in the written word.
